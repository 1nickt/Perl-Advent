Title: Stupid Command Line Tricks
Topic: the -M switch

=head1 The Basics of C<-M>

C<perl> understands a bunch of command line switches.  Some of them, like
C<-f>, you will probably never use.  Others, like C<-e> and C<-d>, you might
use all the time.  The C<-M> switch is somewhere in between.  You might use it
in the most trivial case, but it can probably do a lot more than you know it
can.

The general use case is this:

  perl -M
