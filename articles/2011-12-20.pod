=head1 A Shameful Admission

It has come to pass many times that I've needed to rename a bunch of files.  I
had a bunch of strategies for doing this, and I never picked one and stuck to
using it.  I I<certainly> never build a reusable tool for it, which meant that
every time I did it, I screwed things up in a new and exciting way.

Sometimes a one-liner in shell would do it:

  #!vim sh
  for f in *.txt; { mv "$f" "$f.old" }

Or maybe:

  #!vim sh
  for f in *.txt; { BASE=$(basename $f .txt); mv "$f" "$BASE.yaml" }

Other times, I'd resort to Perl:

  #!perl
  use autodie qw(rename);
  my @files   = grep { -f } <*>;
  for my $file (@files) {
    my $new = $file =~ s/^([0-9]+)/sprintf '%4u', $1/e;
    rename $file => $new;
  }
