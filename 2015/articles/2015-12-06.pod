Title: Calculating cooking times the easy way
Topic: Convert::CookingTimes
Author: David Precious <davidp@preshweb.co.uk>

We've all been there when cooking - you have one thing that should be cooked at
200C for 30 minutes, another that asks for 220C for 35 minutes, and something 
else that only wants 180C for 26 minutes.  However, you only have the one oven,
so there's going to have to be compromises.

After one too many times guessing appropriate adjustments in my head, I decided
"this sounds like something a computer can be doing for me quickly".  So, enter
L<Convert::CookingTimes>.  Given a set of item names, temperatures and
durations, it works out the average of the temperatures requested, then adjusts
the cooking times to suit (so things being cooked at a higher temperature than
normal will get their cooking times reduced and vice-versa).  It will then
present a list of instructions telling you what temperature to pre-heat the oven
to, and what should be put in and when, for everything to end up done at the
same time.

So, let's say we're doing a nice tasty Christmas dinner.

    my ($temperature, @steps) = Convert::CookingTimes->adjust_times(
        { name => 'Turkey',      temp => 180, time => 120, },
        { name => 'Roast spuds', temp => 200, time => 45,  },
        { name => 'Stuffing',    temp => 210, time => 15,  },
    );

The instructions are returned as a set of hashrefs with the keys C<name>,
C<adjusted_time> (how long to cook that thing for in total) and
C<time_until_next> (the amount of time to wait before the next item is added in
order for everything to be done at the same time).

For convenience, that set of hashrefs can be passed to C<summarise_instructions>
to produce a set of human-readable summarised instructions, like:


  "Warm oven up to 200 degrees.",
  "Cooking the whole meal will take 108 minutes.",
  "Add Turkey and cook for 63 minutes",
  "Add Roast spuds and cook for 29 minutes",
  "Add Stuffing and cook for 16 minutes",

Of course, it's an algorithm, not a cook, so you'll want to use a bit of common
sense especially if the range of temperatures was particularly wide - maybe use
a meat thermometer to check for a safe internal temperature if you're unsure!

For ultimate laziness, I have a little web interface on my home server which
presents various stats and CRUD interfaces etc - including one to store the
cooking times and temperatures for things I cook commonly, along with a page I
can go and tick the things I'm planning to cook, hit submit, and the stored
times and temperatures are passed to L<Convert::CookingTimes> to produce a list
of steps to follow easily.  Now, if I can just automate the actual cooking away
too... hmm, I wonder if Just Eat have an API...
